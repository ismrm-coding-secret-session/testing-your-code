# Testing your code

This repository contains simple working examples of how to test your code, in difference languages. Each example is hosted in a branch using the name of that language.

Branches:
* [python](https://github.com/ismrm-coding-secret-session/testing-your-code/tree/python)
* [matlab](https://github.com/ismrm-coding-secret-session/testing-your-code/tree/matlab)
* [octave](https://github.com/ismrm-coding-secret-session/testing-your-code/tree/octave)

For the open-source languages, continous integration (using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com)) and code coverage analysis (using [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io)) are also implemented. Badges displaying the build status (green if all the tests pass, red if they don't) and coverage (% of code covered by tests) are displayed at the top of the readme. Click them to get more in-depth details about these features!
